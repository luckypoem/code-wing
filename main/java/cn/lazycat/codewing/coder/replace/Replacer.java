/**
 * <p>
 *     Replacer is used to replace some special placeholders in a string with
 *     another string  based on a rule. Replacer provides the ability to detect
 *     if there is a placeholder in a string. With the getFeature() method,
 *     you can get the characteristics of this placeholder, which is actually
 *     a regex expression. Coder will retrieve the entire Schema. When it finds this
 *     regex, it will call getStart and getEnd of this interface to get the
 *     offset of the entire placeholder in the string. Then take out the full
 *     placeholder.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     The most important method is replace . This method accepts the placeholders
 *     that Coder retrieves using the getStart and getEnd methods for parsing and returns
 *     the contents of the placeholders. Coder replaces the original placeholders with
 *     this content and proceeds to the next testing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     The replacer needs to use many bean objects in most cases. Therefore, beans are
 *     saved in Replacer by default, indicating the list of bean objects required by Replacer.
 *     The needBeans() method indicates whether this Replacer needs beans. If it is true,
 *     Coder will pass the list of bean objects parsed by the schema to replacer. Subclasses
 *     can choose to have it return false so that beans are null.
 * </p>
